### How to Use

Each top-level folder in this repository corresponds to a specific course. Inside each course folder, individual assignments are further organized into their own subdirectories.

To work with a specific project, navigate to the relevant assignment folder. If the project involves code with specific dependencies (e.g., Python projects with a `requirements.txt` or a virtual environment), please refer to the `README.md` file within that specific assignment's folder for setup instructions.
