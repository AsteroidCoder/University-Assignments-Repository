# University Assignments Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my university assignments repository. This folder contains all the projects, code and related files for the various courses I am currently undertaking. The primary purpose of this repository is to maintain a structured and version-controlled archive of my academic work.

### How to Use

Each top-level folder in this repository corresponds to a specific course. Inside each course folder, individual assignments are further organized into their own subdirectories.

To work with a project, navigate to the relevant assignment folder. The project involves code with specific dependencies (e.g., Python projects with a `requirements.txt`). You should create a dedicated virtual environment for that project. This keeps its dependencies separate from others. To do this, navigate into the project's folder from your terminal and run the following commands:

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
  python -m venv .venv

2. **Activate it:**
  cmd
      .\.venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install the dependencies:**
  pip install -r requirements.txt
